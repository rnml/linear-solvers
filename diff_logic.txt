meaning of the edge

     k
  a ---> b

strategy 1: a - b <= k

  the constraint becomes stronger as k decreases

  maintain length of shortest path from zero
    zero --(-k)--> a
    zero - a <= -k
    a >= k

  non-negative a

    iff  - a <= 0

    iff  zero - a <= 0

    iff        0
         zero ---> a

  for GC: list incoming edges

  negative paths are inconsistent (0 = a - a <= k)

strategy 2: a - b >= k

  the constraint becomes stronger as k increases

  maintain length of longest path to zero
    a --(k)--> zero
    a - zero >= k
    a >= k

  non-negative a

    iff  a >= 0

    iff  a - zero >= 0

    iff     0
         a ---> zero

  for GC: list outgoing edges

  positive paths are inconsistent (0 = a - a >= k)
